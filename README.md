# Tavern
World's End Tavern is open for business!

World's End Tavern is a sim game about providing service to Adventurers at the edge of the world.

- Build your town from a single Tavern to a sprawling hub of adventuring.
- Expand the known world, find dungeons, and defeat the ultimate evil.
- Keep adventurers happy and alive (and paying) by meeting their basic and not-so-basic needs.
- Instead of the power plants, schools, factories etc. of Sim City, think Taverns, Blacksmiths, Potion Shops
- Manage your town resources carefully so that you don't go bankrupt and adventurers stay alive.
- Lots of upgrades


### Look and feel

- Top down, reminiscent of Warcraft 3/Dota
- The edge of the world is literal and visible (giant cliff/drop off... waterfalls, etc.)
