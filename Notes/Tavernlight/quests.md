# Quests

One of the things you manage are commissioned quests to your adventurers. Available quests appear in a menu, and the player must spend money to make those quests available. Rewards are for rare commodities, gold, etc.

## Mechanics

- Access a menu with available quests
- Available quests determiend by current stage of game and which buildings you have
- Pulled from a stable of qualifying quests randomly

## Early Game

- Explore surroundings
- Simple bounties on named mobs in open field (i.e. not in a dungeon)
- Discover dungeons ("Rumore has it that a dungeon exists...")
